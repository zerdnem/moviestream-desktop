### API Request Flow

```
1. User clicks "Watch" on content without subtitles
   ↓
2. Dialog appears with loading indicator
   ↓
3. SearchSubtitles() called with:
   - Title
   - User's preferred language (from settings)
   - Season/Episode (if TV show)
   ↓
4. API request to opensubtitles.com/api/v1/subtitles
   Headers: Api-Key, User-Agent, Content-Type
   ↓
5. Parse JSON response, extract subtitle info
   ↓
6. Display results in dialog
   ↓
7. User selects subtitle and clicks "Download & Play"
   ↓
8. DownloadSubtitle() called:
   - POST to /api/v1/download with file_id
   - Get temporary download link
   - Download actual .srt file
   - Save to temp directory
   ↓
9. Launch player with subtitle file path
```

## Settings Integration

The feature automatically uses the user's subtitle language preference:

```go
// In subtitles/manager.go
func (m *Manager) SearchSubtitles(title string, tmdbID int, season, episode int) ([]SubtitleResult, error) {
    userSettings := settings.Get()
    language := userSettings.SubtitleLanguage  // ✅ Uses user preference
    
    results, err := m.openSubtitles.SearchByTitle(title, language, season, episode)
    // ...
}
```

### How It Works

1. User sets subtitle language in Settings (e.g., "Spanish")
2. When no subtitles found, dialog appears
3. API searches for Spanish subtitles first
4. If no Spanish subtitles, falls back to English
5. Results displayed in preferred language

## User Experience

### Movie Example
```
1. User watches "The Matrix" (no embedded subtitles)
2. Dialog appears: "Searching for subtitles..."
3. Found 50 subtitles (English priority if set)
4. User sees:
   ○ English (en) - The Matrix (1999)
   ○ English (en) - The Matrix HD
   ○ Spanish (es) - La Matrix
   ...
5. User selects preferred subtitle
6. Clicks "Download & Play"
7. Subtitle downloads and video starts
```

### TV Show Example
```
1. User watches "Breaking Bad S01E01" (no embedded subtitles)
2. Dialog appears: "Searching for subtitles..."
3. Found 35 subtitles for this specific episode
4. User sees episode-specific subtitle results
