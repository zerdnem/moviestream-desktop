# Subtitle Confirmation Dialog Feature

## Overview
Added **confirmation dialogs** that ask users if they want to play without subtitles when subtitle fetching or downloading fails. This gives users full control instead of automatically playing videos without subtitles.

## What Changed?

### Before
```

    ‚Üì
Video automatically plays without subtitles
    ‚Üì
User: "Wait, I wanted subtitles!"
```

### After (NEW!)
```
Subtitle fetch/download fails
    ‚Üì
Dialog: "Would you like to play without subtitles?"
    ‚Üì
User chooses:
  ‚Üí "Play Without Subtitles" - Video plays
  ‚Üí "Cancel" - Nothing happens, user stays in app
```

confirmDialog := dialog.NewConfirm(
    "Dialog Title",
    "Message explaining what happened.\n\nWould you like to play without subtitles?",
    func(play bool) {
        if play {
            // User chose to play without subtitles
            if err := player.PlayWithMPVAndCallback(streamURL, title, []string{}, onEnd); err != nil {
                dialog.ShowError(err, currentWindow)
            } else {
                fmt.Printf("\n‚ñ∂ Playing: %s\n", title)
                fmt.Printf("   ‚ö† No subtitles loaded\n\n")
            }
        } else {
            // User cancelled
            fmt.Println("‚úó Playback cancelled by user")
        }
    },
    currentWindow,
)
confirmDialog.SetDismissText("Cancel")
confirmDialog.SetConfirmText("Play Without Subtitles")
confirmDialog.Show()
```

### Code Changes in `gui/autosubtitles.go`

**Line 33-62:** No subtitles found dialog
**Line 91-120:** No valid subtitles dialog
**Line 165-191:** Both sources failed to provide dialog
**Line 208-233:** All downloads failed dialog
**Line 247-273:** Single source failed dialog (movies)

Each failure point now shows a confirmation dialog instead of auto-playing.
