# View Mode & Cover Images Feature Summary

## Overview
Added a view mode toggle to search results with support for both Grid View and List View, including cover images for all movies and TV shows.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added View Mode State Management (`gui/app.go`)
- Added `viewModeRadio` variable to store the view mode selector
- Added `lastViewMode` variable to track the current view mode (defaults to "Grid View")
- Created `refreshSearchResults()` function to re-render results when view mode changes

### 2. View Mode Toggle UI (`gui/app.go` & `gui/navigation.go`)
- Added horizontal radio group with "Grid View" and "List View" options
- Placed below the search bar for easy access
- Toggle automatically re-renders search results without re-fetching data
- View mode persists when navigating back to search results

### 3. Grid View Implementation
**Movie Grid View (`createMovieGridView`)**:
- 3-column grid layout
- Large poster images (150x225px)
- Title centered below poster
- Rating displayed with star icon
- Tappable cards that open movie details

**TV Show Grid View (`createTVGridView`)**:
- Same 3-column grid layout
- Large poster images with show name and rating
- Tappable cards that open TV show details

### 4. Enhanced List View
**Movie List View (`createMovieListView`)**:
- Horizontal layout with poster on the left (100x150px)
- Title, rating, year, and overview on the right
- "Watch" button for quick access
- More detailed information visible without clicking

**TV Show List View (`createTVListView`)**:
- Similar horizontal layout with poster
- "Episodes" button for quick access
- Show information and overview visible

### 5. Cover Image Loading
- Uses existing `LoadImageFromURL()` utility from `imageutil.go`
- Leverages TMDB's `GetPosterURL()` API function
- Images load asynchronously with placeholder
- Images are cached for performance
- Handles missing posters gracefully

## Technical Details

### API Integration
- Movie and TVShow structs already included `PosterPath` field
- `api.GetPosterURL()` converts path to full TMDB URL
- Image URLs: `https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/[poster_path]`

### Image Loading
- Asynchronous loading with placeholders
- Caching prevents redundant network requests
- Different sizes for grid (150x225) vs list (100x150) views
- Fill mode set to `ImageFillContain` to maintain aspect ratio

### User Experience
- View mode persists across navigation
- Instant switching between views (no network delay)
- Smooth integration with existing search functionality
- Works for both Movies and TV Shows

## Files Modified
1. `gui/app.go` - Main view logic and rendering functions
2. `gui/navigation.go` - Navigation with view mode persistence

## Testing
