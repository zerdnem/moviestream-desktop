# Auto Subtitle Download Feature

## Overview
Subtitles are now **automatically searched, selected, and downloaded** without user interaction. The system intelligently picks the best subtitle and plays the video immediately.

## What Changed?

### Before
```
No subtitles in stream
    â†“
Show dialog with list of subtitles
    â†“
User selects subtitle
    â†“
User clicks "Download & Play"
    â†“
Download subtitle
    â†“
Play video
```

### After (NEW!)
```
No subtitles in stream
    â†“
Auto-search OpenSubtitles and Addic7ed
    â†“
Pick best subtitle (OpenSubtitles first, then Addic7ed)
    â†“
Auto-download best subtitle
    â†“
Play video immediately âœ“

(No dialog, no list, no user interaction needed!)
```

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Search
When no subtitles are found in the stream, the system automatically:
- Searches **OpenSubtitles** for subtitles
- Searches **Addic7ed** for subtitles (TV shows only)
- Gets user's preferred language from settings

### 2. Best Subtitle Selection

**Priority Order:**
1. **First** OpenSubtitles result (if available)
2. **First** Addic7ed result (if no OpenSubtitles)

**Why this priority?**
- OpenSubtitles has broader coverage (movies + TV)
- OpenSubtitles typically has more subtitle options
- Addic7ed is TV-only, so it's a natural fallback

### 3. Automatic Download
Once the best subtitle is selected:
- Downloads automatically in background
- No user confirmation needed
- Shows brief "Loading Subtitles..." progress indicator

### 4. Automatic Fallback
If first download fails:
- **TV Shows**: Automatically tries Addic7ed
- **Movies**: Plays without subtitles
- All automatic, no user intervention

### 5. Graceful Degradation
If no subtitles are found or all downloads fail:
- Plays video **without subtitles**
- Shows console message: "âš  No subtitles found. Playing without subtitles."
- No error dialogs, no interruption

## Implementation Details

### New File: `gui/autosubtitles.go`

**Function: `AutoDownloadAndPlaySubtitles`**

**Parameters:**
- `title` - Movie/episode title
- `tmdbID` - TMDB ID for searching
- `season`, `episode` - TV show info (0 for movies)
- `streamURL` - Video stream URL
- `onEnd` - Callback for auto-play features

**Flow:**
```go
1. Search subtitles (manager.SearchSubtitles)
   â†“
2. Separate by source (OpenSubtitles vs Addic7ed)
   â†“
3. Pick best (OpenSubtitles first, then Addic7ed)
   â†“
4. Download best subtitle (manager.DownloadSubtitle)
   â†“
5. If download fails AND TV show:
   - Try Addic7ed as fallback
   â†“
6. Play video with or without subtitle
```

## Comparison with Previous Behavior

| Aspect | Previous (Dialog) | New (Auto-Download) |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **User clicks** | 2+ clicks required | 1 click (Watch) |
| **Time to play** | 5-10 seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| **User attention** | Must review and select | No attention needed |
| **Subtitle choice** | User chooses | Auto-picks best |
| **Failures** | User must retry | Auto-fallback |
| **No subtitles** | User must click "Play Without" | Auto-plays |

## When Manual Selection Might Be Desired

The auto-download feature is optimal for most users, but some might want manual selection:

### Users who might want manual mode:
- Want specific subtitle versions (e.g., SDH, Hearing Impaired)
- Prefer certain subtitle release groups
- Want to see all available options
- Have very specific subtitle preferences

### Future Enhancement (Optional):
Could add a settings toggle:
```
[ ] Auto-download subtitles (recommended)
    When enabled, automatically picks and downloads the best subtitle

[ ] Show subtitle selection dialog
    When enabled, shows list of available subtitles for manual selection
```

## Technical Notes

### Subtitle Source Detection
Uses ID format to distinguish sources:
```go
if len(result.ID) > 0 && result.ID[0] == '/' {
    // Addic7ed (path like "/updated/1/167242/0")
} else {
    // OpenSubtitles (numeric like "167242")
}
```

### Fallback Logic (TV Shows Only)
```go
if sourceName == "OpenSubtitles" && season > 0 && episode > 0 {
    // Try Addic7ed as fallback for TV shows
    addic7edClient := subtitles.NewAddic7edClient()
    addic7edResults, _ := addic7edClient.SearchByTitle(...)
    // Download from Addic7ed
}
```

### Progress Indicator
Shows brief "Loading Subtitles..." dialog:
- Appears immediately when searching starts
- Hides when download completes or fails
- Non-blocking (user can still use app)
- Automatically dismissed
