## Technical Implementation

### Progress Dialog Lifecycle

**Old approach (single dialog):**
```go
progress := dialog.NewProgressInfinite("Loading", "Searching...", window)
progress.Show()
// ... do all work ...
progress.Hide()
```

**New approach (stage-specific dialogs):**
```go
// Stage 1: Search
searchProgress := dialog.NewProgressInfinite(
    "Loading Subtitles", 
    "Searching for subtitles from OpenSubtitles and Addic7ed...", 
    window)
searchProgress.Show()
// ... search ...
searchProgress.Hide()

// Stage 2: Download
downloadProgress := dialog.NewProgressInfinite(
    "Downloading Subtitle", 
    "Downloading from OpenSubtitles...", 
    window)
downloadProgress.Show()
// ... download ...
downloadProgress.Hide()

// Stage 3: Fallback search (if needed)
addic7edSearchProgress := dialog.NewProgressInfinite(
    "Searching Addic7ed", 
    "Searching for subtitles from Addic7ed...", 
    window)
addic7edSearchProgress.Show()
// ... search addic7ed ...
addic7edSearchProgress.Hide()

// Stage 4: Fallback download (if needed)
addic7edDownloadProgress := dialog.NewProgressInfinite(
    "Downloading Subtitle", 
    "Downloading from Addic7ed...", 
    window)
addic7edDownloadProgress.Show()
// ... download from addic7ed ...
addic7edDownloadProgress.Hide()
```

### Code Changes in `gui/autosubtitles.go`

    currentWindow)
fyne.Do(func() {
    downloadProgress.Show()
})
```

**Line 106: Download console indicator**
```go
fmt.Printf("‚¨á Downloading subtitle from %s...\n", sourceName)
```
