## Technical Details

### Architecture
```
GUI Layer (app.go, tvdetails.go)
    ↓
Dialog Layer (subtitlesdialog.go)
    ↓
Manager Layer (manager.go)
    ↓
API Client Layer (opensubtitles.go)
    ↓
OpenSubtitles REST API
```

### Data Flow
1. **Detection**: Check if `subtitleURLs` is empty
2. **Search**: Query OpenSubtitles API with title/season/episode
3. **Display**: Show results in modal dialog
4. **Selection**: User selects preferred subtitle
5. **Download**: Download selected subtitle to temp directory
6. **Playback**: Launch player with subtitle file path

### Concurrency
- Dialog opens on UI thread
- Subtitle search runs in goroutine
- Results update via `fyne.Do()`
- Download runs in goroutine
- Playback starts on UI thread

### Error Handling
- Network errors display error message in dialog
- API errors show user-friendly error text
- Download errors show error dialog
- Zero results show "No subtitles found" message

## Language Support

### Supported Languages
English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Hindi

### Language Preference
- Uses subtitle language from app settings
- Falls back to English if preference unavailable
- Shows language name and code in results

## Player Compatibility

Works with all supported players:
- **MPV**: Direct URL or file path
- **VLC**: Downloads to temp, passes file path
- **MPC-HC**: Downloads to temp, passes file path  
- **PotPlayer**: Downloads to temp, passes file path

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ **Fully backwards compatible**
- Existing functionality unchanged
- Only adds new behavior when subtitles are missing
- No breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- No new dependencies required

## Testing Status

✅ **Build Status**: Successful
- `go mod tidy` - Completed
- `go build` - Completed with no errors
- No linter errors

## Dependencies

**No new external dependencies added**
- Uses only Go standard library
- Existing Fyne GUI framework
- Existing player integration

## Configuration

**No configuration required**
- Works out of the box
- Uses existing language settings
- No API keys needed (free tier)

## Performance Impact

**Minimal performance impact**:
- Only activates when no subtitles found
- Async operations don't block UI
- Single API request per search
- Small file downloads (typically < 100KB)
- Temp files cleaned up automatically

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Multiple subtitle source support
- [ ] Subtitle caching to avoid repeated searches
- [ ] Manual subtitle file upload
- [ ] Subtitle preview/ratings
- [ ] Automatic subtitle sync adjustment
- [ ] Permanent subtitle storage option
- [ ] OpenSubtitles authentication for enhanced features

## Documentation

Created three documentation files:
1. **SUBTITLE_DOWNLOAD_FEATURE.md** - Complete feature documentation
2. **SUBTITLE_FEATURE_TESTING.md** - Testing guide and scenarios
3. **CHANGES_SUMMARY.md** - This file, change overview

## How to Use

### For Users
1. Build and run the application: `go build && ./moviestream-gui`
2. Search for and select content to watch
3. If no subtitles are available, a dialog will appear automatically
4. Select a subtitle and click "Download & Play"
5. Enjoy your content with subtitles!

### For Developers
See the architecture and data flow sections above. The implementation is modular and easy to extend with additional subtitle sources.

## Summary
